\section{Test Results}
\label{sec:testresults}

Because we have chosen to split the evaluation of the system into two boxes, the results will also be presented in two section. The Unit Testing of the system began much earlier than the user evaluation, and the user evaluation will continue through christmas and the next year until the project's exam. It is possible more system functions will be evaluated as well, but any potential findings and results of this nature, will be described during the examination.

\subsection{Unit Tests}

A framework called \textbf{QUnit} was used to set up the Unit Tests for the project. From \textbf{QUnit}'s own webpage:

\begin{quotation}
QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself!\cite{qunit}
\end{quotation}

\textbf{QUnit} was quite simple to set up, and with the accompanying CCS files the results were also presented clearly. We managed to Unit Test central functions in the code, with the \textbf{Board}, the \textbf{Cell} and the \textbf{Instructions} being fully covered.  However we did not Unit Test every class at the time of writing. It is possible further Unit Tests will be created afterward as we continue our user evaluation.


We found that Unit Tests did not uncover new bugs, as our test cases all passed. We found however, that we have eased documentation for future work on this project with new.
