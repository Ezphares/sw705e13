Edutainment is a term used to define the union of education and entertainment. The most common games in this 
particular genre, is typically restricted to younger students with the hope to teach basic math and grammar. This 
motivated the group to create an edutainment game, where the target group is both much older, and the material being 
taught is also much more advanced. The game has been tested on two fronts, by using Unit Tests, and making the game 
available to the entire Internet giving participants the opportunity to sharing their unrefined opinion about the 
game, by answering a survey and commenting on the forums the game was advertised. The game is available through a modern browser and was programmed in JavaScript.
