\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

The requirements for this project are divided into practical (game-related) requirements and requirements with regards to the edutainment-oriented 
aspects of the project. First the edutainment requirements gathered from the analysis will be presented, followed by the game-related requirements.

\subsection{Edutainment}

From the games examined in \autoref{sec:privateconsumers} and \autoref{sec:eduinsch}, the following requirements have been established: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Global Conflict and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? series focuses on being helpful for different subjects such as social studies and medialogy. While this is commendable, it is out of scope for this project. This project should focus on teaching a single subject.
	
	\item The graphics of Global Conflicts are mediocre compared to games put out by commercial game studios. However, Global Conflicts is a popular game despite the lack of good graphics. It is therefore more important in this project to focus on the story, realism and relatablity of the game, which is what both Global Conflics and The Oregon Trail did, instead of focusing on graphics. This is why 2D-graphics will be utilized instead of 3D, and the graphics will be created in open-source tools, such as paint and \todo{another graphics tool}.

	\item Many tablet games are targeted at younger children and as such considerations for a more mature audience should be made. It should be noted that more commercial and complex games are finding their way onto tablets, e.g. Infinity Blade on the iOS platform.

	\item The Oregon Trail manages to make learning engaging without sacrificing gameplay, which is absolutely a requirement for this project. It focus on depicting a realistic situation to the player to interact with which what our game should aspire to, however this is not a definite requirement.

	\item The browser-based games in general are very explicit in their intent to teach. This should be avoided, since the idea is to teach people something without explicitly stating "now you are learning!". 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Practical}

 & GUI/HUD & \\

\end{tabular}

The reasoning behind the priorities are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Graphics are highly needed, because the game emphasizes a visual approach to learning programming constructs and a console oriented approach 
would therefore not be viable.

\item A Program Editor is needed to allow the users to interact with the game.

\item Environment covers the world in which the user's code is executed. This is the "playing field" of the game, where the user sees the results of 
their programming and as such is essential to make the game engaging.

\item A Manual is needed to teach users how to interact with the game. Optimally, the game should be designed to naturally teach the player how to play 
the game without a manual, but in the case that this is not achieved, a manual is essential.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Save and Load are functions in the game, that would allow the user to save a program to the central database and load it into the editor and work 
on it further. Being able to save progress is a feature that we want to implement, since starting from scratch every time can be a source of 
frustration for the player, thereby making the game less enjoyable.

\item Multiplayer, while not crucial, is an important aspect of the gamification of learning. It would allow users to compete against each other, which 
is a highly motivating factor.

\item Challenges would allow the user to complete problems, that require a specific program construct while gaining a sense of accomplishment.

\item AI is needed as a replacement for multiplayer to have users compete against an opponent. Either AI or multiplayer should be implemented to make 
the game playable.

\item GUI/HUD would be useful to display information about the entities in the game and let the user know how they are doing. This is different from 
Graphics, since Graphics only focus on visual representation of game, not very aspect of the world is included. This is included in the GUI/HUD 
requirement.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Animation. It is not crucial that the entities are animated, however good animations server to draw visually inclined people and as the game is 
based on graphical programming, it would be a nice feature to have.

\item Leaderboards/ranking system would be nice to sharpen the competitive element. As some people are fiercely competitive, having a leaderboard to 
climb could make them spend more time on the activity.

\item An interactive tutorial would be nice to have for people who do not like to read game manuals, but want to get started right away.

\item Export/import would allow the user to save their files locally and work on them even while not connected to the internet. This would mean a lot 
to users who wish to spend time perfecting their program and would therefore be a nice feature to have, however not essential.
\end{itemize}
