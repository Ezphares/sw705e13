\section{Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}
The requirements for this project are divided into practical or game-related requirements and requirements with regards to the edutainment-oriented aspects of the projects. First the edutainment requirements gathered from the analysis will be presented, then the practical requirements with regards to the game.

\subsection{Edutainment}
From the games the following requirements have been established: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Global Conflict series focuses on being helpful for different subjects such as  social studies and medialogy. While this is commendable it is out of scope for this project. This project should focus on teaching a single subject very well. 

\item The graphics of the Global Conflict game are mediocre compared to games put out by commercial game studios and this may annoy some players because many people today are used to seeing excellent 3D-graphics in games. However, in this project, 2D-graphics could be utilized as these are not expected to be lifelike.

\item The tablet games are small, non-complex games focused on teaching single subjects, which should definitely be what this project should aspire to. However, these games are targeted at small children and as such considerations for a more mature audience should be made.

\item Oregon Trail manages to make learning engaging without sacrificing gameplay which is absolutely a requirement for this project as well.

\item The browser games in general are very explicit in their intent to teach something. This should be avoided in this project, seeing as the idea is to teach people something without explicitly stating that "now we are learning!". 
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that the game Carnage Heart could serve as an excellent inspiration for GUI design.
