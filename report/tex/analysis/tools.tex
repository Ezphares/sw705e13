\section{Development Tools}

\label{sec:tools}

When development a browser based game, several options are available. Six of them are of some interest
HTML5, Flash, Java, Shockwave, Silverlight and Unity. The development tools for Flash and Shockwave are not free\cite{adobe13}, however,
and as such not an option for this project. The rest of them will be introduced in this section.

\subsection{HTML5, Canvas and WebGL}
HTML5 is the latest standard for implementing web-pages, and the current recommendation from \ac{w3c}\cite{html513} and includes several
useful APIs for implementing multimedia, specifically the canvas element, which provides an area where graphics can be drawn.
HTML5 games will be written in javascript, which is interpreted by the browser, and as such is available on most computer systems.

The canvas can be further improved using the external WebGL extension\cite{khronos13}, which allows for hardware accelerated graphics in the canvas,
and as such eliminates much of the low performance that can arise from software accelerated graphics.
Additionally, WebGL is implemented by default in most modern browsers, so most users will be able to play the game
without downloading any additional software.
