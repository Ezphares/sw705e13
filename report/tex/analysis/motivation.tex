This section will explain the motivation for this project and will be concluded with a finalized problem statement.


Many people interact daily with computers without knowing how a computer works. There are many aspect of how a computer works, but one aspect is how programs are written.
Software is included in an increasing number of products, and it is a field that keeps expanding.
It is therefore important, that we get more people to realize, that computers are not too complicated and dangerous to work with.
We might be able to get more people interested in learning programming languages, if we provide a transition tool, that teach people basic structures in programming, and how these structures can be combined to form working programs.


Games are sometimes used as a learning tool, where the purpose is to have fun while learning.
However, we feel that many edutainment games (entertaining educational games) are boring and few exist that focus on older children.
We are therefore motivated to create an existing and engaging edutainment game as the transition tool, where the target consumers are older children. 


With the introduction of tablets and applications, the market for games has increased, and many edutainment games are available on these platforms; iOS, Android, and Windows mobile.
It is important for us, that the product produced in this product can be used on many platforms and are therefore not restricted to ex. Apples App Store and Google Play.
The motivation for creating a highly available product is to provide as many people with a transition tool, that makes basic programming skills more common.


It is important to state, that the motivation is not to teach users a specific programming language.
Rather it is important for us, that constructs in mostly imperative languages are understood, such as if-else-statements, loops, variable types and handling of variables, and that the user can get a visual representation of when a program is executed.


Essentially the motivation for developing an existing and engaging edutainment game in this project is to make people interested in programming by providing a transition tool and have them consider getting an education in Software Engineering, so that the increasing demand on software in the future can be met by the number of educated software engineers.
