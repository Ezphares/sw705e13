\section{Gamification}
\label{sec:gamification}
Gamification is 
\begin{quote}
	the process of game-thinking and game mechanics to engage users and solve problems
\end{quote}
\cite{Zichermann2011}, i.e. using core elements of games to attract users and keep them coming back to a specific task.
Since making our final product engaging is one of our requirements, see \autoref{sec:requirements}, gamefication is a natural way of approaching the problem of making an educational game engaging.\newline

Gamification is used in many areas, for example in engaging users in solving complex tasks.
The browser-based game 'FoldIt', developed at the University of Washington in $2008$, employs people in folding proteins.
Folding proteins is a task that the brute-force approach of computers does worse than humans, since humans have a natural abilities with regards to spatial reasoning and 3D pattern matching.
In $2011$ a team of users managed to decode an AIDS-causing monkey virus in just $10$ days using 'FoldIt'.
This was a task, which had been unsuccessfully attempted by scientists for $15$ years.\cite{Huff2011}
Today, the game has almost $500.000$ registered users, that use some of their spare time to fold proteins for science for free.\cite{FoldIt2013}\newline

'FoldIt' works, because it employs game mechanics and dynamics, that correlate with some of the primary human desires that will keep people interested and engaged in the activity.
Figure \ref{fig:bunchball} shows the interaction between human desires, such as status, competition, and reward.
If the game mechanics shown are used, more people would possibly feel entertained while using the product.
This is beneficial to a product that, for example, educates the user.\todo{Do we use any of the game mechanics?}

\end{figure}\todo{Barbara: Source + explain why some balls are blue and why others are red}

As can be seen, the human desires can be fulfilled via various game mechanics.
'FoldIt' utilizes a leaderboard, which allows the users to compete against each other either as groups or soloists.
Allowing both groups and soloists to compete makes the game appealing to both individualists and team players.
If only groups could compete, it might impact the amount of individualists, that would participate.
We see, that appealing to a wider range of character types increase the number of people, that use the game.
This is something, that should be taken into account when developing our game.\todo{We do not take this into consideration during development}\todo{From Martin: This is very nice argumentation. If you want to make ti event better in the conclusion or reflection you can mention this that you have incorporated this aspect of competition in your game and reference gamification source.}\newline

In the online application 'FreeRice', developed for the World Food Program, the user's desire for altruism/selflessness is fulfilled via donations of rice grains for completed tasks, while general academic skills are honed, such as vocabulary and basic mathematical proficiency. Again, it is possible to join groups, and the game also utilize a leaderboard, thereby introducing the competition desire.\cite{freerice}\newline

As has been described, the game mechanics in \autoref{fig:bunchball} will give people an extrinsic motivation (rewards, leaderboards etc.) to keep playing, although the activity might not carry any intrinsic motivation for the user.
This is useful in education, because people tend to easily give up, or simply never really start, when acquiring knowledge and skills that, while useful, may not be their primary field of interest.\todo{Cool statement. Is this based on personal experience or fact?}
Keeping people entertained while learning can ensure that they spend more time on the subject and may also pique their interest in an area, that they might not have explored by themselves.
We also see that challenges is the only game mechanic to engage all the human desires, which is why challenges should be introduced earlier than for example levels and leaderboards.
However, all game mechanics should be considered and the complexity of implementing one game mechanic over another also has an impact on the order in which they should be implemented.
For example, if it is easy to implement the leaderboard game mechanic, it might be implemented before the challenges game mechanic even though challenges fulfill more of the human desires.
The order in which game mechanics are implemented is a decision, that is up to the designers and developers of the product.
