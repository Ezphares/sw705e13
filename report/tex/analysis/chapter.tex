\chapter{Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}

This chapter focus on finding possible solutions to the problem described in our motivation with the lack of software engineers in the future. We will start by defining the quality \textit{availability} vs. our understanding of \textit{accessibility}. Thereafter we will focus on games, that are possible inspiration for the development of our final product. These games must both have a learning and entertainment aspect, and focusing on how some of the features that these game use can possibly be included in our game is an essential part of the analysis chapter. We will also shortly describe the theory behind gamification, and argue for what development tools/technologies we will use. We include a section about the interview with associate professor Kurt N{\o}rmark before making our problem statement and more clearly defining the requirements for our project and product.\newpage
