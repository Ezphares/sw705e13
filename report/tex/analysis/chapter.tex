\chapter{Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}

This chapter focuses on finding possible solutions to the lack of software engineers in the future as described in \autoref{sec:motivation}. We will start by defining the quality \textit{availability} vs. our understanding of \textit{accessibility}. Thereafter we will focus on games that can be an inspiration for the development of our final product, these games must both have a learning and entertainment aspect. Some of the features that these games use can possibly be included in our game, discussing which features and how they are best included is an essential part of this chapter. We will also describe the basic theory behind gamification, and argue which development tools and technologies we will use. Include is a section about the interview with associate professor Kurt N{\o}rmark which helped with the problem statement and defining the requirements of both the product and project more clearly.\newpage
