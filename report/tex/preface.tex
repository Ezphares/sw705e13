\chapter*{Preface}

The following report is written as part of a semester project by five students from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University.
The report is written in parallel with courses in Programming Paradigms, Data Intensive Systems, Agent Technologies, and Web Engineering.
\\

The report is structured as a classic analysis, design, implementation, testing and reflection report, even though the classic waterfall development method was not used.
The report is written in such a way, that it should at least be understandable for students that have completed the $6^{th}$ semester in Software Engineering.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

We would like to thank our supervisor Martin Leginus for providing comments on our report, direction with regards to the project, and for supply additional reading material for inspiration.
Additionally, we would like to thank associate professor Kurt N{\o}rmark for allowing us to interview him.
The interview provided us with documentation and argumentation for selecting the imperative paradigm as the base paradigm for our game.
Lastly, we would like to thank the participants, that have taken the time to test our game and give feedback.
The feedback provided is valuable in terms of possible further development, and it helps us learn more about designing games and web applications in general.
