Given our purpose for the game, it is important that the game is both available and accessible for the user.
This means, that the user can easily get the game, and that he/she intuitively knows how the game is supposed to work, and what he/she has to do to win the game.
The challenge will be to create a game, which manages to educate, while maintaining engaging gameplay for the user.
Many ideas to do this are described in the analysis part of this report.
The following sections will describe some game design ideas, and how a solution that achieves this could look in the early stages of the design phase.\newpage
