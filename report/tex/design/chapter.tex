\label{cha:design}

Given the purpose of the game, it is important that it is both available and accessible for the user.
This means, that users can easily get to the game, that they intuitively knows how it is supposed to work, and what they have to do to win.
The challenge will be to create a game, which manages to educate, while maintaining engaging gameplay for the user.
Many ideas for this are described in \autoref{cha:analysis}.
The latter sections will describe some game design ideas, and how a solution that achieves this could look in the early stages of the design phase.\newpage
