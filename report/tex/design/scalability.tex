\section{Scalability}
When scaling up a system for many users, it is often difficult to know exactly how many resources you need. In our case, scaling the system up should be reasonably efficient as a user only connects to the server when the page is loaded. After that, all computation is done on the client machine and will therefore not stress the server more than once per user session.\newline

There are, however, still some things that can be done to lower the server load further. One such thing is to minify the JavaScript code and move it to a single file instead of a file for each class. Doing this will minimize the amount of data that the server will need to send every time a user connects, it will also lower the number of HTTP requests drastically, as each user will only need to request one JavaScript file instead of many. Another similar solution would be to move all sprites into one single image, this would not necessarily reduce the size, but it would also reduce the number of HTTP requests to the server.
