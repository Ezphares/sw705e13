\subsection{Additional Cell Attributes}
It is possible to extend the game by given the cells attributes. One implementation option would be, that the player have $x$ amount of points in the beginning of the game. These points could then be distributed unto different attributes. These could include:\\

\verb|Speed|, which would affect the amount of movement actions each cell could perform each turn.\\
\verb|Vision|, which would affect how far away the cell could look and maybe how accurate the cell would observe cells in the distance.\\
\verb|Strength|, which could be an additional parameter when attacking. The attacking power would then be equal to the health/energy of the cell plus some modifier of the strength of that cell.\\

We did not think, that it would make sense to include a health attribute, since a health attribute for example would limit how much health each cell could contain, which we do not find to be a good approach. However, we have not user tested this theory, and we might be incorrect in our assumption, that all players would invest heavily in the health attribute not focus on the others.
