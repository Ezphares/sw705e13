\section{Known Issues}
\label{sec:known_issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item There are no tutorials to teach people the game, which means the users have to read the manual.
\item The manual does not mention that going out of bounds will kill a cell.
\item There is a lack of information available to the user during execution of their programs.
\item The game is not playable in all browsers, and users with older computers may not have a graphics card that supports WebGL.
\item The graphics of the editor are currently misleading in that the move and split instructions depict a red cell, where the user, in fact, plays the green cell.
\item Users on mobile devices are unable to play the game, seeing as the editor does not support drag-and-drop.
\item The menu is currently hard-coded which means that changing the resolution of the game is problematic.
